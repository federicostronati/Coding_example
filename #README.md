# Coding_example
In this repository you can find some examples of codes I've wrote in Stata and R.

About Stata dofile:
The working folder was organized in 3 subfolders - as it is shown by the "Folder organization" .png file - :
"Code" containing the codes "import_program" and "append"
"Data" containing a subfolder called "Raw" with raw data to clean and a subfolder called "Clean" with cleaned data.
"Log" containing the log file

By running the Master_cleaning do file it would be possible to perform the data cleaning and aggregation. 
Cleaned data are stored in the "(...)/Data/Clean" subfolder.

About R:
This is a script I wrote with other collegues to complete some data analysis.
This was 50% of the exam "Statistics for High Dimentional data", taught by professor Cagnone, University of Bologna.

If you need any further clarification don't hesitate to contact me:

Note: it is the first time I am using Github, therefore I hope you can forgive some clumsiness in the file organization (if any).
